<h1>Homelab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a repurposed laptop running an Ubuntu Server 22+ OS. I began this project before creating this page, so some sections may not be as complete. I have gone through the creation of this server with the help of online guides and videos. Some uses and applications I have configured are remote SSH via OVPN, Pi-Hole, and the built-in UFW
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Linux CLI</b> 
- <b>Pi-hole</b>
- <b>SSH</b>
- <b>Open VPN</b>
- <b>Linux UFW</b>
- <b>Docker</b>
- <b>More to come</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Ubuntu Server Version 22.x</b>

<h1>Initial setup</h1> <br/>
I decided to opt for a physical server as that is my preference and I felt it would be more of a challenge to set up and get running, instead of using any preconfigurations with cloud software. I had an Acer laptop lying around that my father never used, so it seemed like the perfect piece of hardware to repurpose into something useful. The first thing I did was physically integrate it into my SOHO network by simply using a category 5e ethernet cable and plugging it into my nice little tplink switch. <br/>
 It had Windows 11 installed on it, but obviously that was not going to do. I opted for an Ubuntu server since it was completely free and it would give me more experience with Linux as a whole, also it would be more lightweight. Configuration was fairly simple, but I did have some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Btkx9toufg">help</a> to make sure nothing would instantly destroy itself. I made sure to give it a static IP too, so I could always easily access it from my other computers. After creating another account so that I was not always in root, it was pretty much sqaured away for me to start adding programs and experimenting.
